========================
Standard parameters
========================

Where possible, we attempt to indicate external experimental conditions such as temperature or pressure in the HybriD3 database. In many references, such conditions are implicitly or explicitly specified in a generic fashion, such as room temperature, ambient conditions, etc. In such cases, we use standardized values for the respective parameters in the HybriD3 database as follows:

-----------------
Temperature

We use T = 298 K for "room temperature"
